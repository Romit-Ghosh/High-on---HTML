    Futala Lake is a lake in Nagpur in the Indian state of Maharashtra. 
    The lake covers 60 acres (24 ha).
     Built by the Bhosle kings of Nagpur, the lake is known for its coloured fountains.
      In the evenings the site is illuminated with halogen lights and Tanga (carriage) rides. 
      The lake is surrounded on three sides by forest and a landscaped beach on the fourth side.
      The area has become the most attractive spot in Nagpur City and, on average, 1,000 visitors visit the lake daily.
      Much work is still to be done including the construction of the hill steps, sand beach paving on the platform, Nana-Nani park, etc. on the south side of the lake.
     Also, a water pond and garden are to be developed on a triangular plot opposite Hanuman Temple.
     Excessive nutrient load (C, N and P) in Futala lake has caused heavy growth of water hyacinth, water lily, hydrilla, wolffia, potamogeton and algae.
