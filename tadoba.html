  The Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve is a wildlife sanctuary in Chandrapur district of Maharashtra state in India.
  It is Maharashtra's oldest and largest national park.
  Created in 1955, the reserve includes the Tadoba National Park and the Andhari Wildlife Sanctuary.
  The reserve consists of 577.96 square kilometres (223.15 sq mi) of reserved forest and 32.51 square kilometres (12.55
  sq mi) of protected forest.<br><BR><BR><BR>
  Winters stretch from November to February; during this season, daytime temperatures are in the 25°–30 °C range and the
  park is lush green.
  While summers are extremely hot in Tadoba, with the temperature rising to 47 °C, it is the ideal time to sight mammals
  near lakes
  as vegetation is minimal. The monsoon season begins in June; the area receives heavy rainfall during this season
  (approx.1275 mm) and
  humidity hovers around 66%.
  After the scorching summers where the mercury rises up to 48 degrees, the arrival of monsoon in June is a big relief.
  Though the climate becomes highly humid, the rains do not fail to revive the jungle.
  As the rains make the terrain inaccessible the core zones of the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve are closed between July
  and September and
  only buffer zone is open for the tourists. The visit to Tadoba National Park in monsoon is a sheer bliss where you can
  witness a completely different Tadoba.<BR><BR>

  seven per cent of the protected area.
  Teak is the predominant tree species. Other deciduous trees found in this area include ain (crocodile bark), bija,
  dhauda,
  hald, salai, semal and tendu. Beheda, hirda, karaya gum, mahua madhuca (crepe myrtle), palas (flame-of-the-forest,
  Butea monosperma) and
  Lannea coromandelica (wodier tree). Axlewood (Anogeissus latifolia, a fire-resistant species), black plum and arjun
  are some of the other
  tropical trees that grow in this reserve.

  Patches of grasses are found throughout the reserve.
  Bamboo thickets grow throughout the reserve in abundance.
  The climber kach kujali (velvet bean) found here is a medicinal plant used to treat Parkinson's disease.
  The leaves of bheria are used as an insect repellent and bija is a medicinal gum. Beheda is also an important medicine
  found here.<BR><BR>
