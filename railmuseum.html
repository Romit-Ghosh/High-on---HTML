        The Narrow Gauge Railway Museum (Welsh: Amgueddfa Rheilffyrdd Bach Cul) is a purpose-built museum dedicated to narrow-gauge railways
         situated at the Tywyn Wharf station of the Talyllyn Railway in Tywyn, Gwynedd, Wales.

The museum has a collection of more than 1,000 items from over eighty narrow-gauge railways in Wales, England, the Isle of Man,
 Ireland and Scotland. This includes six locomotives on display (and several others in store or at other sites);
  eleven wagons inside with a further eleven outside; a display showing the development of track work from early plateways 
  to modern narrow-gauge tracks; several large signals along with single line working apparatus and documents; a growing collection 
  of tickets and other documents, posters, notices, crockery and souvenirs; relics from vehicles scrapped long ago and the Awdry Study, 
  re-created with the original furniture and fittings in memory of the Rev. Wilbert Awdry, an early volunteer on the 
  Talyllyn Railway best known for his series of railway books such as "Thomas the Tank Engine."<BR><BR><BR>
